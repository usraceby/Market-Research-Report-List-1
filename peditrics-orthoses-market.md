<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peditrics Orthoses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pediatrics orthoses market features two primary types of helmets: active and passive. Active helmets are designed to actively shape a child's skull through the application of controlled pressure, often used for conditions like positional plagiocephaly. In contrast, passive helmets provide stabilization and protection without exerting active force on the skull, allowing for natural growth while preventing further flattening. Both types are essential in promoting healthy cranial development in infants, addressing various orthopedic concerns effectively.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Peditrics Orthoses Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plagiocephaly</li><li>Brachycephaly</li><li>Scaphocephaly</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pediatrics orthoses market focuses on corrective devices for cranial deformities such as plagiocephaly, brachycephaly, and scaphocephaly. Plagiocephaly is characterized by an asymmetrical head shape, often caused by prolonged positional pressures. Brachycephaly features a broad, flattened head, typically from lying flat. Scaphocephaly involves an elongated head shape due to early fusion of cranial sutures. Orthotic interventions effectively reshape the skull and promote normal development in infants, catering to growing awareness and demand for non-invasive treatment options.</p></p>
