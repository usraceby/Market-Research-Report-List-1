<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tissue Heart Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stented Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Stentless Tissue Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tissue heart valves market comprises two primary types: stented and stentless tissue heart valves. Stented tissue valves feature a supportive framework that aids placement and stability within the heart, making them easier to implant and providing durability. In contrast, stentless tissue valves lack this framework, allowing for a more natural fit and potentially improving blood flow and hemodynamics. Each type offers distinct advantages, catering to varied patient needs and preferences in minimally invasive heart surgery.</p></p>
