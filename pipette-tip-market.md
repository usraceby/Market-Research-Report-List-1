<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipette Tip Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Filtered Pipette Tips</li><li>Non-Filtered Pipette Tips</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pipette tip market is categorized into two primary types: filtered and non-filtered pipette tips. Filtered pipette tips contain a barrier filter to prevent aerosols and contaminants from entering the pipette, making them ideal for sensitive applications and preventing cross-contamination. Non-filtered pipette tips, on the other hand, lack this barrier and are suitable for less critical tasks, offering a cost-effective solution for routine laboratory work. Each type serves distinct purposes based on the required level of accuracy and contamination control.</p></p>
