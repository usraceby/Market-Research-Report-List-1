<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PET Bottle Embryo Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Injection Molding"</li><li>"Compression Molding"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PET bottle embryo market is characterized by two primary manufacturing techniques: injection molding and compression molding. Injection molding involves melting PET resin and injecting it into a mold to create preforms, which are later blown into bottles. This method allows for precise control and high production rates. In contrast, compression molding involves placing PET material into a heated mold and applying pressure to shape it. This technique is often faster and requires less energy, making it suitable for specific applications in bottle production.</p></p>
