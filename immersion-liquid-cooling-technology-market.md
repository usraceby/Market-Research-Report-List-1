<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immersion Liquid Cooling Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-phase Liquid Cooling</li><li>Single Phase Liquid Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Immersion liquid cooling technology encompasses two primary market types: two-phase liquid cooling and single-phase liquid cooling. </p><p>In two-phase liquid cooling, the coolant evaporates at the heat source, absorbing heat and then condensing back to liquid, enabling efficient heat transfer. Conversely, single-phase liquid cooling maintains the coolant in a liquid state, circulating it to absorb heat, making it straightforward but less efficient at high temperatures. Both systems are used to enhance cooling in high-performance computing and data centers, optimizing thermal management.</p></p>
