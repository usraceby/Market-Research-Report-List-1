<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intravascular Temperature Control System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravascular Warming</li><li>Intravascular Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intravascular temperature control system market encompasses two primary types: intravascular warming and intravascular cooling. Intravascular warming systems utilize heated intravenous fluids to maintain or elevate a patientâ€™s core temperature, essential in surgical procedures or trauma cases to prevent hypothermia. Conversely, intravascular cooling systems use chilled fluids to lower core body temperature, beneficial in conditions like cardiac arrest or heat stroke. Both types enhance patient outcomes by precisely regulating thermal status during critical medical situations.</p></p>
